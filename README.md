## Abstract
We have determined that Regent Square is the best neighborhood to live in. This conclusion was made based the following metrics: number of arrests, gun seizures, and median home value. Less arrests means less crime in the neighborhood as fewer people are being jailed for breaking the law. Fewer gun seizures also leads to less gun violence in the neighborhood. The neighborhoods that have low values in these metrics are safer to live and therefore better. Neighborhoods with high median house values are also better as they provide higher quality living in the house and likely the surronding area. While Regent Square was not the best in all of these individual metrics, it had the best rankings across all three metrics and therefore we decided it would be the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh.
