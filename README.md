## Abstract
We have determined that **Regent Square** is the best neighborhood to live in. This conclusion was made based on the following metrics: _number of arrests, gun seizures, and a neighborhood's median home value_. Less arrests means less crime in the neighborhood as fewer people are being jailed. Fewer gun seizures also leads to less gun violence in the neighborhood. The neighborhoods that have low values in these metrics are safer to live and therefore better. Neighborhoods with high median home values imply that the location, condition of the neighborhood, or the houses themselves are favorable. All these factors that are implied through the median home value metric make a neighborhood look appealing. While Regent Square was not the best in all of the individual metrics, it had the best rankings out of all of our candidates. Therefore, we decided that Regent Square is the best neighborhood in Pittsburgh.
